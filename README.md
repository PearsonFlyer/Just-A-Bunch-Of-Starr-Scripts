# Scripts

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/angrycuban13/just-a-bunch-of-starr-scripts/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/angrycuban13/just-a-bunch-of-starr-scripts) [![made-with-powershell](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Powershell-1f425f.svg)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)

These scripts interact directly with Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr API for the most part. Someone wanted to do *X* and the tool didn't exist at the time, however, *X* can be accomplished via the API, so I wrote a script for it. Feel free to read through their respective READMEs to see if any of them would work for you.
